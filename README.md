# EKS Microservice template

If this is your first time here, please read [Our getting started guide](https://senndergmh.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PLE/pages/1609302474/Getting+started+with+SennCloud) first.

## What it is

This repository is the InfraOps team reference implementation of a microservice in EKS using Terraform and Helm.

## What it is not

A service template (we're basically not python developers) - tldr; everything that's under `src` : Handle with care!

## Features
- state of the art EKS deployment
- fastapi
- public endpoint (API GW)
- out of the box gitlab pipeline
- fully templated
- optional database support (RDS)
- extra cheese

## Quickstart

**‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Please use the develop branch on your first commit, otherwise you may find weird behaviours on the CI pipelines ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è**

**‚ö†Ô∏èüíª If you haven't set a Personal Access Token to execute Terraform locally, check first this [link](https://sennder.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PLE/pages/2473459723/Using+GitLab+s+Terraform+module+registry#Local-setup)! üíª‚ö†Ô∏è**

```sh
# Enter project directory
cd <repo_name>

# Initialise git repo
git init
```

## Setting up your dev infrastructure from local

```sh
# Change directory to iac/
cd iac/

# Plan your shared infrastructure resources (ECR)
./plan.sh shared

# Apply your shared infrastructure resources (ECR)
./apply.sh shared

# Plan your dev infrastructure resources (ECS, ...)
./plan.sh dev

# Apply your dev infrastructure resources (ECS, ...)
./apply.sh shared
```

## API Gateway integration

You can access your service via the API Gateway in two environments:

| Environment   | URL                                          |
| --------------|:--------------------------------------------:|
| dev           | https://api.dev.cloud.sennder.com/<app_name> |
| prod          | https://api.cloud.sennder.com/<app_name>     |

Your service will be automatically secured via a lambda authorizer in the API Gateway. In order to access your services resources, add an 'Authorization: ' Header to your request containing a mothership token for either (staging) `https://sennder-sennder.stg.sennder.com` or (production) `https://api.sennder.com/`.

You can test your API Gateway integration as follows:

```sh
$ curl 'https://sennder-sennder.stg.sennder.com/auth/login/' \
  -H 'authority: sennder-sennder.stg.sennder.com' \
  -H 'accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'origin: https://app.orcas.stg.sennder.com' \
  -H 'referer: https://app.orcas.stg.sennder.com/' \
  --data-raw '{"email":"USERNAME","password":"PASSWORD"}'

{
  "key": "TOKEN"
}

$ curl -v -H "Authorization: Token TOKEN" https://api.dev.cloud.sennder.com/<app_name>/api/v1/health | jq
```

## Database integration
In case you chose the database option, your database will be automatically created once you run your pipeline.
The pipeline will pull the database secret from your CI/CD variables, please ensure that you set the `TF_VAR_database_master_password` for the environments dev and prod!
You can find the endpoint of your database in the [AWS console](https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=eu-central-1#databases:)

Your database will be set up as follows:

| Attribute     | Value                                                                                                        |
| --------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| DB_HOST       | Check the [AWS console](https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=eu-central-1#databases:) |
| DB_PORT       | 5432                                                                                                         |
| DB_USER       | Your provided app-name (without '-') + env (dev|prod)                                                        |
| DB_NAME       | Your provided app-name (without '-')                                                                         |
| DB_PASSWORD   | According to your `TF_VAR_database_master_password` per environment                                          |

Those values will be automatically injected as environment variables into your ECS service.

## SonarCloud Integration
If you chose the SonarCloud Option, the SonarCloud Job has been added to your pipeline.

### You need a couple more steps to activate it!
1. Run the script in the project's root directory `sonarcloud.py`\
Which offers a handy cli which will call SonarCloud API to create project under [sennder org](https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/sennder/projects).
> Instructions on how to run the script are self-contained within the CLI.

2. Add the following env vars to your project's CI. In GitLab, go to Settings > CI/CD > Variables.
  - Define the SONAR_TOKEN = "token generated for your project after running above script"
    - Make sure that the Protect variable checkbox is unticked\
    - Make sure that the Mask variable checkbox is ticked.
  - Define the SONAR_HOST_URL = https://sonarcloud.io
    - Make sure that the Protect variable checkbox is unticked\
    - No need to tick the Mask variable checkbox this time.
